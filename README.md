# RakhiDev
Hi there 👋 I’m Rakhi Singh

Welcome to my GitHub space!
I’m a Frontend Developer (SDE-1) with 3+ years of professional experience, specializing in building scalable, high-performance, and accessible web applications using React and modern frontend technologies.

I’ve worked extensively on enterprise-scale client products, owning features end-to-end and consistently delivering high-quality UI solutions under tight timelines.

💻 What I Do

I focus on crafting clean, maintainable, and performant user interfaces that solve real business problems.

My core areas include:

Building reusable and scalable React component architectures

Performance optimization and reducing unnecessary re-renders

API integration and async data handling

Accessibility-first and responsive UI development

Collaboration with backend, product, and design teams

🚀 About Me

I’m passionate about frontend engineering and continuously improving UI quality, performance, and user experience. Over the past 3+ years at Grazitti Interactive, I’ve handled large client projects independently, received consistent kudos for ownership and delivery, and actively contributed beyond my role by mentoring juniors and taking internal training sessions.

I enjoy solving complex UI problems, improving developer experience, and keeping up with evolving frontend ecosystems.
